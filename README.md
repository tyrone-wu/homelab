# Homelab

Documenting my journey on learning and setting up my homelab.  
Right now, I only have my main Windows PC so I don't exactly have much to work with. 

#### My host specs: 
- Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X Six-Core Processor 3.60 GHz
- RAM: 16GB
- System type: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor
- OS: Windows 11 22H2
